# python-crackmes/obfuscated python code
I've created some python crackmes.  

Some crackmes (or shall I call them obfuscated python code :)) in the beginner levels may seem complicated but they aren't!  
Use a bit of your time and figure it out. They aren't that hard, trust me.  

# how to solve

most of them require an user input to check the key so you could run the program

# difficulties

The folder name is the difficulty level of the crackme  
  
1: eZ  
2: Beginner  
3: Normal  
4: Hard  
5: Expert  
experimental: These are new crackmes where I am not sure if they are good how they are (yeah, I love my english). You can still try to solve them and give me some feedback on it
