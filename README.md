# python-crackmes/obfuscated python code
I've created some python crackmes.  

Some crackmes (or shall I call them obfuscated python code :)) in the beginner levels may seem complicated but they aren't!  
Use a bit of your time and figure it out. They aren't that hard, trust me.  

# How to solve

most of them require an user input to check the key so you could run the program

# Difficulties

The folder name is the difficulty level of the crackme  
  
- 1: eZ  
- 2: Beginner  
- 3: Normal  
- 4: Hard  
- 5: Expert  
- fowe: You have to find out what the program does **without** executing the program itself. Your key/flag shall be the name of the algorithm!  
- experimental: These are new crackmes where I am not sure if they are good how they are. You can still try to solve them and give me some feedback on it
